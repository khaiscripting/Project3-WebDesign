            Hi, I’m Khai. Majoring in Interaction Design, minoring in Media
            Design
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I made the mistake of taking two courses at once. So while I’m doing
            Web Design, I’m also simultaneously doing Creative Coding. This
            isn’t something that I can control because these classes have set
            times. There are no other alternatives unless I take a different
            course. It’s fine though, I am willing to do this. The description
            of Web Design sounds interesting as we look into how we can create
            websites for the people, how we incorporate design principles, and
            learn the basics of web structure.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            If you are wondering where I am going to be when I’m
            procrastinating, I’ll be gamin’ on life, drooling over croissants,
            typing on a keyboard for a keyboard (65% gang), and philosophizing
            why I’m procrastinating.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Oddly enough, Procrastination is a topic to be talked about in
            Design Psychology.

            I had to dip 7 minutes before the lecture ended. Last thing I
            remembered was using AI.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>The course material seems very interesting:</p>
          <ul style="padding-left: 6rem">
            <li>Create a Persona</li>
            <li>Create a Journey Map</li>
            <li>Write some Stuff</li>
            <li>Make a plan for a website</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            Lots of steps for the planning. From the sound of it, I feel more
            excited for the second Assignment; when we do make the website using
            CMS or CODING (HTML/CSS). I actually don’t know what a CSM is so
            maybe I should figure that out.
          </p>

          <p>In the lecture this week, we took a crack at making a persona.</p>
          <p style="font-style: italic; padding-left: 2rem">
            I took a look at my figma files to try look for the persona I made
            in my group, but I lost it cause I signed in anonymously sooooo… i
            lost it

            My goal by next week is to have started the basic boring personality
            of my persona, maybe even flesh out with motivations and goals…

            I took the flatmate’s whiteboard and started using it to create my persona. It’s like putting yourself in the shoe of another person and pretending to be them and know them. Is that what empathy is? Empathy is a good value to have as a designer, especially a user experience designer. 
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Next week I’ll try to make the Venn Diagram based on this persona I made.

            It’s hand-in week. I’m writing this on a Monday… Well, now it’s Tuesday. I got all my assets done. I then wrote my methodologies and reasons behind the choices I made with the personas, Venn diagram, user flows, and journey map. <a href="https://www.statista.com/">Statista</a> helped me with a lot of useful information to back up my reasoning. Here’s hoping I did read the assignment correctly and handed in the material required. I should have asked for feedback but oh well.

            I'm currently in Blenheim for some reason.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Over this time, I didn’t do a lot of Web Design. I was out in the middle of nowhere with no devices but my phone. The most I could do right now is to sketch up ideas for the website design. This low-fidelity design is just made up of quick squares and random scribbles and notes.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

    <div class="scrollcards">

        <h3>break (2)</h3>
        <div class="main-text">
          <p>
            Got back from a little trip. It’s time to translate my random scribbles and confusing words into a non-interactive medium-fidelity wireframe. Using Figma, I will use basic rectangles and grayscale to create a cohesive and consistent prototype. I recreated some pages multiple times and iterated them so the design was consistent throughout all the pages. What I wanted to remain the same throughout all the pages was the navigation bar. To start this, I took inspiration from websites like YouTube, Netflix, and Neon. This way I create an experience users might similarly feel when browsing other video/film websites. This in User Experience is known as “Jakob’s Law”.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            My biggest obstacle was trying to figure out the correct spacing and size of elements. I don’t want it to be too large and claustrophobic. I don’t want elements to feel like they cluster too much on the page. Then again, I don’t want too much whitespace and wasted potential. There were quite a number of iterations and minor tweaks until I got the design I felt was consistent. Oopsie, I may or may not have ended up designing around 18 different designs for the splash page.

        <h3>week seven</h3>
        <div class="main-text">
          <p>
            This week, I doubled down in the final stretch to try and get as much done as done. 
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            With the design that I was satisfied with, I used <a href="https://realtimecolors.com/">Real Time Colors</a> to create (too many) colour palettes and brand styles. I felt it was best if the website had a form of Art Deco. Art Deco was the era of craftsmanship and luxury. Many theatres showed features of Art Deco. Similarly, I want my website to follow this experience. A theatre to showcase craftsmanship and luxury.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Finally, after that was done. It was time to translate my final iteration and incorporate the brand identity while incorporating the interactivity of a website. I spent a good 1-2 days working on components that I could drag and drop on all the pages. Though it seemed like it was time-consuming, it was able to save me a lot of time since I didn’t need to recreate the same object over and over again. Another advantage to components is how much cleaner the interactions ‘webs’ are. One component controls all copies of it. An annoying thing I found, was that some components had to be on the same page as the final design. This is because if a component has a hidden state, it does not have logic and memory built into it, meaning by default, it has no state.

            This is now the part 2 of Assignment 2. I now have options to chose from. Either I could use HTML/CSS to create my website, or a CMS. Weighing up the options. I will try start with HTML/CSS to try and see how long it would take to design a simple navigation bar. 
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            NEVER MIND. I was informed we only got 1-2 weeks to work on this. Trying to understand how to create a simple navigation bar took me 1 day. Imagine how long it would take to design 1 page.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="scrollcards"">
      <div class="week-card reveal">
        <h3>week nine</h3>
        <div class="main-text">
          <p>
            With the time constraint in mine, I decided to go to WebFlow and create my website using that. Again, I started with the navigation bar. This time it took me an hour to understand how to use the CMS tools. What was confusing about it was how to position elements. 
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Next was creating a barebone version of a carousel. Since my Figma design was 90% carousel, I was thinking I could create a component and copy/paste it down the page.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="scrollcards">
      <div class="week-card reveal">
      <img class="card-image" src="images/week10.JPG" alt="a persona of margot" width="100%" height="auto">
        <h3>week ten</h3>
        <div class="main-text">
          <p>
            Yeah, my head hurts. I’ll come back to the main page to deal with the carousel. I’m just confused how to fix the spacing problem. It looks like a < div > is outside another < div > could be a margin or padding issue. I don’t know. Instead, I started making other pages. The “Profile” page. I was going to make more at the same time, but it looks like I can only have 2 pages with Webflow Premium.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            On Profile, I want to try to see how much I’ve learnt with the new tip for myself. I also played around with grids and sectioned items. I think I really got the hang of it. However, I feel like I may be using too much < div > when some items just stack on each other without a < div >.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="scrollcards">
      <div class="week-card reveal">
        <h3>week eleven</h3>
        <div class="main-text">
          <p>
            Going back to the carousel. I’ve been thinking. It most likely was a margin/padding problem. But not on the carousel. But on the item above it. If the item above had a large top padding, it might have pushed itself down behind the carousel causing an overlap.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Yep, that’s one of the problems. The next problem to be fixed was scaling. I created a component just for video cards, so I could reuse the same card. The problem is, the scaling of the images is off.  When the page is too wide, it stretches too long and the text below doesn’t scale with.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            It was a display issue. Fixed it partially. The carousel moves with the sizing of the website. But margin changes instead of size of the video cards. Going back to the carousel. I’ve been thinking. It most likely was a margin/padding problem. But not on the carousel. But on the item above it. If the item above had a large top padding, it might have pushed itself down behind the carousel causing an overlap.
