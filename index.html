            Hi, I’m Khai. Majoring in Interaction Design, minoring in Media
            Design
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I made the mistake of taking two courses at once. So while I’m doing
            Web Design, I’m also simultaneously doing Creative Coding. This
            isn’t something that I can control because these classes have set
            times. There are no other alternatives unless I take a different
            course. It’s fine though, I am willing to do this. The description
            of Web Design sounds interesting as we look into how we can create
            websites for the people, how we incorporate design principles, and
            learn the basics of web structure.
          </p>

            If you are wondering where I am going to be when I’m
            procrastinating, I’ll be gamin’ on life, drooling over croissants,
            typing on a keyboard for a keyboard (65% gang), and philosophizing
            why I’m procrastinating.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Oddly enough, Procrastination is a topic to be talked about in
            Design Psychology.
